### Hi, I'M Tirthesh Bohra 👋

From the age of 15, I have been able to build a computer from scratch. I knew the hardware. I got introduced to the software when I started working as an accountant. Gathering data and creating interactive dashboards was the part of the job that I enjoyed the most and wanted to explore the most. I used basic tools like Excel, Tally, etc. As time passed I realized that I was quick and good at what I was doing and decided to act on it. That has been my journey from commerce to coding.

I joined Masai School to pursue web development. Here, I have learned various frameworks, collaborated with many people, worked on many projects and assignments. I can see myself growing as an enthusiastic web developer and look forward to working as one.

Apart from coding I love playing FPS multiplayer titles, chess, have a profound interest in game theory, and proactively follow the newest inventions in the tech world.

My toolkit includes: Node.js, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Express, React, npm, Javascript, Git/GitHub.
